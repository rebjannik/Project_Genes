## DNA project - how to use
Either download the entire source code in one go and run it on prefered IDE or by using the jar file on the command line with specified extra memory and heap size. Creates 4 extra files if correct data is given, a mapping file for expanding the project if contig names will be needed or not, a processed files with valid pairs but not sorted, a degreeDistribution csv file, and a DensityDistribution csv file. All files were created to save memory, space and time when running the code again and again. There will also be two images of a graph. All of this, except for the huge data file can be found in this repository.
