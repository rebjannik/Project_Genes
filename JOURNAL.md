After a long struggle with trying to figure out how to make github and git work on it's own, the simple solution that after 2021 they changef the way you can connect was a god's sent. Now the git flow is finally up and running and I can start working on the first part of the project, the graphs and shell script.

Decided to create two classes, one for nodes and one for the graph in it's own. The idea is that when running the main program that all questions will be answered. Decided to use the SHA-256 algorithm for converting the long names into 32bit sized integer. The next step is going to be to start actually creating the nodes and edges, but that will be saved for tomorrow as I feel done today.
